# Employee Attrition Prediction — NYU ML Project

This project uses supervised machine learning to predict employee attrition using structured HR data. Developed as part of NYU's Machine Learning course (Spring 2025). Received **outstanding instructor feedback** for real-world relevance, robustness, and ethical focus. Extended in 2026 with production-grade ML practices: SHAP explainability, fairness auditing, model calibration, and artifact serialization.

## Abstract

Attrition leads to loss of talent, increased recruitment costs, and lowered productivity. This project trains and evaluates ensemble models (XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest) on the IBM HR Analytics dataset to predict which employees are likely to leave — enabling proactive, data-driven HR intervention.

## Instructor Feedback

> "**Excellent work on this project!** You've gone above and beyond expectations in terms of scope, practical applicability, and rigor.
> Your focus on explainability, fairness, and real-world HR impact is exactly how machine learning should be applied.
> You've clearly understood the purpose of the project, evaluated your model pipeline thoroughly, and thought deeply about interpretation."

## Key Highlights

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Dataset | IBM HR Analytics (1,470 records, 34 features) |
| Models | Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, CatBoost |
| Class Imbalance | SMOTE pipeline — resamples training set only; F1/AUC comparison with vs. without |
| Top Model Accuracy | 86% (XGBoost) |
| Explainability | SHAP TreeExplainer — beeswarm, waterfall, dependence plots |
| Fairness Audit | `fairlearn` MetricFrame — demographic parity + equalized odds across gender, age, marital status |
| Calibration | Reliability diagrams, isotonic regression, Brier score, threshold optimizer |
| Artifact Management | `joblib` serialization of model + scaler + `model_metadata.json` |
| Business Insight | Overtime, low income, low job satisfaction → top predictors of attrition |

## Live Demo

| Low Risk Profile | Medium Risk Profile |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Low Risk](screenshots/Screenshot%202026-05-06%20at%2004.02.40.png) | ![Medium Risk](screenshots/Screenshot%202026-05-06%20at%2004.02.54.png) |

The frontend predicts attrition probability, risk tier (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW), SHAP feature impact bars, and an LLM-generated plain-English explanation for HR managers. Preset profiles and a randomizer enable instant testing.

**Docker (recommended):**
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Then open `http://localhost:3000`. API at `http://localhost:8000`.

**Manual:**
```bash
# Start API (port 8000)
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# Serve frontend (port 3000)
cd frontend && python3 -m http.server 3000
```

## EDA Insights

- Younger employees (<30) and those with <2 years tenure had the highest attrition rates
- Overtime and low job/environment satisfaction were the strongest behavioral predictors
- Sales department and Lab Technician role faced the highest turnover
- Commute distance and low income had compounding attrition risk effects

---

## Models and Evaluation

Models evaluated on:
- Accuracy
- F1-Score (minority class: Attrition = Yes) — primary metric
- ROC-AUC (CatBoost: 0.737, XGBoost: 0.73–0.91)
- Confusion Matrix
- Brier Score (calibration quality)

Ensemble models (XGBoost, CatBoost) significantly outperformed linear and distance-based models.

## Production-Grade Extensions (2026)

### SHAP Explainability
`TreeExplainer` provides exact SHAP values (no approximation). Outputs include:
- Beeswarm summary plot — global feature impact distribution
- Bar chart — mean |SHAP| feature ranking
- Waterfall plot — per-employee prediction explanation
- Dependence plots — feature interaction with top predictors

### Fairness Audit
`fairlearn.MetricFrame` measures per-group accuracy, F1, precision, recall across:
- **Gender** — checks for disparate prediction rates
- **Age Group** (18–30, 31–40, 41–50, 51+) — checks for age-based bias
- **Marital Status** — checks for marital status disparity

Demographic Parity Difference and Equalized Odds Difference reported per group. Threshold: |< 0.10| per EEOC guidance.

### Probability Calibration
Reliability diagrams for XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest. Isotonic regression calibration applied to XGBoost with Brier score before/after comparison. Threshold optimization sweep (precision/recall/F1 vs. threshold) with recommended HR operating point (high recall).

### Artifact Management
`joblib` serialization of trained XGBoost model and StandardScaler. `model_metadata.json` captures training date, feature names, and evaluation metrics. Load-and-predict demo cell verifies reproducibility.
